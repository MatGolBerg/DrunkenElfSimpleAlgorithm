This is my solution to a problem encountered in the recruitment of a colleague.

Santa delivers presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.

He starts by delivering a present to a house in the location, and then the North Pole elf calls him on the radio and tells him where to move now. Moves are always exactly one house north (^), south (v), east (>) or west (<). After each move, he delivers another gift to the house in his new location.

However, the elf at the North Pole drank a little too much alcohol, so his directions are not very accurate, with the result that Santa visits some houses more than once and others he does not visit at all. How many houses will receive at least one present?

Instruction:
Given input file containing characters "<>^v" that indicate the road of Santa Claus' sleigh count how many homes will be visited at least once during his journey.

My answer is 1747 houses
